        <p>This project shows a static map displaying spaceports across the US along with community centers in Florida. 
            The map also aims to identify the proximity of Florida community centers to spaceports through buffer analysis. 
            Both layers were reprojected to EPSG: 5070 - NAD 83 to enable accurate distance calculations in miles. A 1-mile buffer was created around spaceports to search for overlapping community centers, but no intersections were found. 
            This analysis helps contextualize the infrastructural dynamics and informs future focus group discussions in Florida communities.
